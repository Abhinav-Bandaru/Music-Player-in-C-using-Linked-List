# Music-Player-in-C-using-Linked-List

The aim of this project was to make it possible to create a playlist out of the songs present on one's system, because some of the songs we like might not be available on the online music streaming platforms. With this program you can make a playlist of the songs you enjoy right on your system.

The playlist was created using linked list.
## In case you try to run this code, I would recommend using CodeBlocks. Once you copy the source code into the file, navigate to Project Menu on the top Menu Bar.
## Project -> Build Options -> Linket settings -> Other linker options
## Under the Other linker options, type, "-lwinmm".
## You're all set to go!

You'll have to manually replace the filepath in the code (Lines 238-242) to the filepaths in your system and make sure to preserve the format of the path as in the original code.
